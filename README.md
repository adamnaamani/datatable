## Time Spent

The entire process took roughly 3 days, with most of the time spent during Saturday to bring all the elements together (Vue, Webpack, Firebase, Heroku). While I wanted to follow the guidelines, I thoroughly enjoy continually improving the style and function, however I felt time was of the essence and kept it as simple as possible to first display my understanding of all the frameworks.

## Component Adaptation

The Datatable component is modular as is, since it pulls in data from Vuex and Firebase. I would add more custom functionality in regards to selecting columns, modifying rows, pagination, CRUD options, etc., however that was beyond the scope of the requirements.

## Favorite CSS property

As a designer using CSS, modern properties such as Flexbox and CSS Grid have become an area of focus, as it can be complex, yet provides the most flexible solution for responsive layouts. It also moves me away from relying on archaic practices like table structure which can be limiting and difficult to style.

## Favorite modern Javascript feature

Definitely component based architecture. I have grown fond of modern Javascript frameworks, as I come from humble roots like most developers using jQuery, which is highly unscalable and a nightmare to maintain as the codebase grows. This has made me appreciate the compartmentalization and connection to the DOM that Vue or React offers, and makes developing fun again.

## Favorite Vue.js library

VueNumeric has become my go-to number formatter. It can become complex to have two-way data binding and format user input as they type, particularly with currency. I have used this in my datatable application for the amount column.
